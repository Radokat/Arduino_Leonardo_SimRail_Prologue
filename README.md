# Arduino_Leonardo_SimRail_Prologue
Controlling "SimRail - The Railway Simulator: Prologue" via an Arduino Leonardo.
## Requirements:
* Arduino Leonardo
* 2 potentiometers of your choice
* 3 buttons
* 3 10k resistors
## Connections:
Connect a potentiometer to A0 to regulate the power.  
Connect a potentiometer to A1 to regulate the local brake.  
Connect a button to pin 12 for operation the left door.  
Connect a button to pin 11 for operation the AWS.  
Connect a button to pin 10 for operation the right door.  
  
Adapt the potentiometer values in the script corresponding to your potentiometers/liking, mine are for RSA0N12-LIN10K.
